**About Me**
My favorite hobbies are drawing and playing video games.
I got interested in these hobbies because of social media mostly and friends recommending it to me.
I spend about 1-2 hours on drawing when I'm not drawing anything major and for video games would be 2-4 hours depending if I have quests and events to do.
